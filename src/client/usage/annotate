Usage: chop annotate [<options>]

Annotate with scores the CFG based on collected samples and 
additional metrics. This step requires 'chop count' command first.
Each instruction is annotated (a score is computed) with the 
percentage of samples --with respect to the total number of samples 
in the database-- in that particular instruction.
Optionally, one can normalize these percentage
based on the number of instructions in each basic block, functions
and module. The normalization is based on number of instruction to
avoid biased due basic block, function or module sizes (i.e. the
chances of a big basic block to be sampled are proportional to the
size of the basic block. With the normalization that bias is 
minimized). Later invocations of this command will override previous
information.

Options:
  -data <path>  Path to database file. (default: chop.db)
  -normalize    Normalize annotation based on number of instructions
                in a basic block.
