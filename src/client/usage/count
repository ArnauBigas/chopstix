Usage: chop count [<options>]

Annotate the static CFG with collected runtime samples.
Count the total of sample in the database that belong
to each instruction. The count for basic blocks, functions,
and modules is the addition of the count for each instruction
belonging to each particular block, function or module.
This is a required step needed to be able to do the heuristic 
based search ('chop search') based on the sampling afterwards.
Later invocations of this command will override previous
information.
 
Options:
  -data <path>   Path to database file (default: chop.db)
